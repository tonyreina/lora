{"instruction": "How would you counsel a patient starting metformin?", "response": "Metformin helps lower blood glucose by reducing liver glucose production and improving insulin sensitivity. Common counseling points:\n\n- How to take: Start low and increase gradually to reduce stomach upset; take with meals. Extended‑release may improve GI tolerance.\n- Common side effects: Nausea, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort; these often improve with time and dose titration.\n- Hypoglycemia: Low risk when used alone (higher risk if combined with insulin or sulfonylureas).\n- Kidney function: Check eGFR before starting and periodically. Metformin is contraindicated if eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m²; starting therapy when eGFR is 30–45 is generally not recommended. If eGFR later falls below 45, reassess risks/benefits; discontinue if it falls below 30.\n- Rare risk: Metformin‑associated lactic acidosis is rare but more likely with severe kidney disease, severe liver disease, hypoxia, or acute illness/dehydration—seek care if very unwell.\n- Contrast procedures/acute illness: Follow local protocol for temporary holding around iodinated contrast or when acutely ill/dehydrated.\n- Long‑term: Periodically consider vitamin B12 levels (especially with anemia or neuropathy symptoms).\n\nReinforce lifestyle measures, home glucose/A1c monitoring as appropriate, and follow‑up for dose adjustment and tolerance.\n\nMedication choice and dosing must be individualized (age, renal/hepatic function, pregnancy, comorbidities) and should follow current local protocols/guidelines.", "source_urls": ["https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/SearchResults?query=How+would+you+counsel+a+patient+starting+metformin%3F", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/?term=How+would+you+counsel+a+patient+starting+metformin%3F", "https://medlineplus.gov/search/?query=How+would+you+counsel+a+patient+starting+metformin%3F", "https://www.fda.gov/files/drugs/published/Drug-Safety-Communication-FDA-revises-warnings-regarding-use-of-the-diabetes-medicine-metformin-in-certain-patients-with-reduced-kidney-function-%28PDF%29.pdf", "https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/fda/fdaDrugXsl.cfm?setid=0448c618-2f0d-4ed3-866f-74b413cf902d", "https://professional.diabetes.org/standards-of-care", "https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/48/Supplement_1/S6/157564/Summary-of-Revisions-Standards-of-Care-in-Diabetes"]}

{"instruction": "What is the management of acute cocaine-induced myocardial infarction?", "response": "Cocaine: sympathomimetic causing coronary vasospasm, thrombosis, increased myocardial O2 demand. Presentation: chest pain, dyspnea, tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, agitation, paranoia. EKG: ST elevation possible (vasospasm or infarction). Troponin: elevated if infarction.

Complications: arrhythmia (ventricular fibrillation, tachycardia), cardiogenic shock, acute heart failure, aortic dissection risk (from hypertension). Management: benzodiazepines (lorazepam) first-line for agitation/tachycardia/hypertension; avoid beta-blockers alone (unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects worsen vasospasm—use with alpha-blocker). Aspirin 325 mg, heparin, nitrates for vasospasm. PCI if STEMI; consider intra-coronary vasodilators (nitroglycerin, verapamil, adenosine). Avoid catecholamines (dopamine/epinephrine worsen ischemia).
